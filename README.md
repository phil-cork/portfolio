# Portfolio
A collection of projects, assignments, and work to showcase my experience. For the visual presentation aspects of these projects, visit [my website](https://philcork.com/projects).

## LifeScholarship Renewal
As a Data Modeler for the Office of Enrollment Information, I worked to use incoming student applications and upcoming semester schedules to identify students at risk of losing their scholarship eligibility. These scripts show the data cleaning and model tuning and training processes.

## NFL
This project utilized a variety of classification techniques to determine how well a team's seasonal statistics predict their playoff success in the post-season. Included are the datasets created from a combination of Pro Football Focus' stats available online and Vegas betting data. 

## BoardGameGeek
Can the categorical descriptions and mechanics of popular board games illuminate meaningful trends or interesting connections between particular titles and their features? This project explore complexity, popularity, and game's theme and mechanical features to explore tabletop board game trends.

## Starbucks
How can a simulated dataset of Starbucks' customers be clustered into distinct customer profiles? What initial insights can be gleaned from how the K-means model separates these customers based on their level of income?

## US Congress
Based on the voting pattern of a subset of the US House of Representatives, can a simple Random Forest predict the individual's political party? Alternatively, given a voting history and political party, can the model predict how Representatives will vote on a particular topic?

## Misc. Files
This small collection of scripts and notebooks highlight non-project related chunks of code created to better understand statistical concepts.
