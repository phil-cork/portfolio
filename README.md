# Portfolio

A collection of projects not already contained within a larger repository. For visual presentations, deliverables, and discussions, visit [my website](https://philcork.com/projects). Smaller vignettes are organized thematically between Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

## Predicting Scholarship Renewal

[Read More about the Process and Results](https://philcork.com/life-scholarship). As a Data Modeler for the Office of Enrollment Information at the College of Charleston, I worked to use incoming student applications and upcoming semester schedules to identify students at risk of losing their scholarship eligibility. These scripts show the data cleaning and model tuning and training processes. Included in this work was a secondary effort to identify particularly challenging combinations of courses, designed to serve as a resource to advisers who might help students steer clear of particular combinations in their first semester to increase the likelihood of maintaining their scholarship eligibility.

## Predicting NFL Success

[Read More about the Process and Results](https://philcork.com/nfl-playoffs). This project utilized a variety of classification techniques to determine how well an NFL team's seasonal statistics predict their playoff success in the post-season. Included are the datasets created from a combination of Pro Football Focus' stats available online and Vegas betting data.

## Machine Learning

### Classifying US Representatives

Based on the voting pattern of a subset of the US House of Representatives, can a simple Random Forest predict the individual's political party? Alternatively, given a voting history and political party, can the model predict how Representatives will vote on a particular topic?

### Clustering Starbucks Customers

How can a simulated dataset of Starbucks' customers be clustered into distinct customer profiles? What initial insights can be gleaned from how the K-means model separates these customers based on their level of income?

### Predicting Turnout

This notebook includes a custom Naive Bayes Classifier model to investigate how well we can predict whether someone will vote based on a handful of demographic features.

### Predicting Home Sales

This investigation fine-tunes and compares a handful of machine learning models to find the best predictor for home sale prices in Washington D.C.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### BoardGameGeek

Can the categorical descriptions and mechanics of popular board games illuminate meaningful trends or interesting connections between particular titles and their features? This project explore complexity, popularity, and game's theme and mechanical features to explore tabletop board game trends.

### Chicago School Performance

A brief exploration of performance measures for Chicago public schools from 2011-2012 investigating the correlations between a school's environment, safety, family involvement, and overall performance.

### Comparing News Outlets

A short example of using custom-coded text analysis to compare the similarity of new sources and the different ways in which they cover the same stories.

### Global Power Plants

A high-level investigation comparing the presence and capacity of power plants around the world. This exercise provides a baseline view of the impact of renewable energy sources and the challenge and opportunities of replacing non-renewable fueled power plants.

## Misc. Coding

This small collection of scripts and notebooks highlight non-project related chunks of code created to better understand statistical concepts and practice object-oriented programming.
